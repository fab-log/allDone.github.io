# allDone app
This to do application comes in a responsive design including a dark mode. It provides the following features.
- Adding new tasks including optional subtasks.
- Assigning a priority to a task which will change the task color.
- Assigning a due date to a task. If a task is (over)due two exclamation marks are added to the date.
- Editing existing tasks.
- Marking tasks as done.
- Listing and restoring tasks previously marked as done.
- Changing the task order.

The app uses the browser's local storage for saving the tasks. This means that the data is held within that specific browser on that specific device only. In the default settings of the most browsers this garantees a persistance of data as long as the browser cache is not deleted. No authentication is required and the data is not protected in any way. So you should not provide sensitive or very important data as it could be seen by other users and it could be erased by changing the browser settings.

Possible use cases are shopping lists, private activities like holiday planning etc.

Future implementations could include server storage and user authentication (making your data accessible on multiple devices) and multi-language versions.

Feel free to use, download and share the code without any restrictions.
